This is a simple falling sand game engine and sample physics set written in Google Go. The goal of this project is to provide an easy framework for developers to write their own sand physics engines. This is still a heavy work in progress.

The large yellow orb in the center is sand. It is in the middle of falling. The red orb below it is brick, and it will not fall, and will obstruct the sand. The yellow orb on the right is fire. It is in the middle of disipating.
